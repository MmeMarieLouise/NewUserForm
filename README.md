# Intro

This was my first apprenticeship project. It was originally built as an electron app but this repo contains just the client-side work that I completed independently. 

The requirements are below:

> This application uses the Electron framework to present an easy to use interface for a Powershell backend The Powershell script is Create-WTUser.ps1 Within this script, you can see all of the Parameters within the param() block at the top of this script.

> *GivenName*, *Surname*, *Department* are being used. Potentially more of these fields could be added at a later time.

>Additionally, the frontend should be able to present error information, if this is what has been returned from the backend.

>Otherwise, if successful, results are returned to the frontend using datatables.

>The technique used here for running powershell in the backend, and presenting error messages in the frontend, is taken from this writeup: https://xainey.github.io/2017/powershell-electron-demo


Here is the brief:

>At the moment, there is a lonely text input box and a button with default Bootstrap styling. We need some Wellcome styling for this form.

>- [x] Change template to feature Wellcome logo, see here for logo download and brand guidelines: https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/logo-usage
>- [ ] Make layout look better. Bootstrap is installed, but we don't necessarily need to use all the default styling. Keep with best practices and move styling into a CSS file. Use SASS or LESS for extra bonus points (!!).

>Layout suggestions:
>- [x] Make a new button style, taking inspiration from wellcome.ac.uk 
>- [x] Add spacing between the form input and button, see forms on wellcome.ac.uk for ideas
>- [x] Change background colour of box to be more in keeping with brand colours
>- [x] Add descriptive text to explain purpose of form
>- [x] See if you spot anything else to improve!

>When you're finished, push up the branch you've been working on to this repo and open up a pull request against master, assign me as a reviewer!
