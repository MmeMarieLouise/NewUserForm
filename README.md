# Intro

This was my first apprenticeship project. It was originally built as an electron app but this repo contains just the client-side work that I completed independently. 

The requirements are below:

> This application uses the Electron framework to present an easy to use interface for a Powershell backend The Powershell script is Create-WTUser.ps1 Within this script, you can see all of the Parameters within the param() block at the top of this script.

> *GivenName*, *Surname*, *Department* are being used. Potentially more of these fields could be added at a later time.

>Additionally, the frontend should be able to present error information, if this is what has been returned from the backend.

>Otherwise, if successful, results are returned to the frontend using datatables.

>The technique used here for running powershell in the backend, and presenting error messages in the frontend, is taken from this writeup: https://xainey.github.io/2017/powershell-electron-demo
